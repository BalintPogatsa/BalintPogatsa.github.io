How many technical blogs and stackoverflow answers I've read in the last >10 years?
Maybe 100.000? Maybe half million? Hard to guess.
How many I've written? Zero. 
Ok, we can count 1 article - when I got upset that I cannot make [shadow mapping on Android](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/822380/Shadow-Mapping-with-Android-OpenGL-ES) for a hobby project.

So my intention now is to break that circle of passive participation and hopefully give back my cent to the software developer community.

After short research I've decided that the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static website generator combined with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will be a good start.

- works very well with my favourite version control system (Git)
- free to deploy
- this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) made it very easy to start up

My current idea for blog posts is to write about the useful/uncommon solution I've come around with in my practice (I guess bigger part will be related to .NET C#)
